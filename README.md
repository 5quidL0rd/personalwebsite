# Personal Website Project

This website is hosted for free using the "pages" feature of Github. It includes a loading page, floating images, a menu, another very basic website nested within it, assorted buttons, 
an email sending function, and more. Feel free to download and use it as a template to replace with your own info and images, or use it as a jumping off point to build an even better website.
